# Project - Traffic signal violation analysis
- From : Minor 1 - Pandas
- Extension : Analyze violation counts - traffic safety study
- Add-ons : Bar Charts , stats summary
- Difficulty medium

## DESCRIPTION
This Minor-1 project focuses on the analysis of traffic signal violations across different cities using Python and Pandas.
The objective of the project is to study various types of traffic violations, identify their frequency, and understand patterns based on factors such as location, vehicle type, and types of violations.
The dataset used contains 33 columns and 4000 rows.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
- Language - Python
- Libraries - Panda, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (In VSCode)

## STEPS
- First, to perform the analysis, we need a dataset. I have downloaded the dataset "Indian_Traffic_violations" in .csv format from the Kaggle website.
- Next, we start by coding. I have done my coding in VSCode by creating an .ipynb file (Jupyter Notebook).
- We import the pandas library since we have to work on tabular data. And the Matplotlib library for the visual representation of the data.
- I have taken three features for the analysis
    - Location
    - Type of Violation
    - City
- We create graphs for each of these three features and also a pie chart for the visual representation.

## STATISTICAL SUMMARY 

The dataset contains 4000 traffic violation records with numerical attributes related to fines, driver details, vehicle information, and driving behavior.
 
 - The average fine amount imposed is approximately ₹2529, with fines ranging from ₹100 to ₹5000, indicating varying severity of violations.
 - The average vehicle model year is 2009, showing that most violations involve vehicles that are neither very old nor very new.
 - The mean driver age is around 47 years, with drivers ranging from 18 to 75 years, suggesting that traffic violations occur across all adult age groups.
 - The average penalty points are close to 5, with a maximum of 10, indicating moderate to serious violations.
 - The number of passengers per vehicle averages around 3, which aligns with typical private vehicle usage.
 - The average speed limit at violation locations is approximately 60 km/h, while the average recorded speed is about 69 km/h, clearly indicating cases of over-speeding.
 - The mean alcohol level is 0.25, with values reaching up to 0.50, highlighting the presence of drunk-driving cases in the dataset.
 - Drivers have an average of 2–3 previous violations, suggesting repeated non-compliance with traffic rules.
